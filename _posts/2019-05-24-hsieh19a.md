abstract: Sequential decision making for lifetime maximization is a critical problem
  in many real-world applications, such as medical treatment and portfolio selection.
  In these applications, a “reneging” phenomenon, where participants may disengage
  from future interactions after observing an unsatisfiable outcome, is rather prevalent.
  To address the above issue, this paper proposes a model of heteroscedastic linear
  bandits with reneging, which allows each participant to have a distinct “satisfaction
  level," with any interaction outcome falling short of that level resulting in that
  participant reneging. Moreover, it allows the variance of the outcome to be context-dependent.
  Based on this model, we develop a UCB-type policy, namely HR-UCB, and prove that
  it achieves $\mathcal{O}\big(\sqrt{{T}(\log({T}))^{3}}\big)$ regret. Finally, we
  validate the performance of HR-UCB via simulations.
